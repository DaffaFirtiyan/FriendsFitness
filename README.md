# FriendsFitness
A UX prototype for a fictional mobile workout app called Friends Fitness. Designed and made in Adobe XD

## Design Process
I will be dividing the design process into four different categories. These will be the steps I take when working on this project:
1. **Research**
    1. User Personas. 
    >This is to represent a typical user with their goals, frustrations, etc. These will be fictional personas as I won't be doing any typical user research, rather is based from my own experience.
    2. Use Cases.
    >How the users might use this service.
    3. User Journey Maps. 
    >A user's experience when using the app from start to finish.
2. **Brainstorm**
    1. User Flow. 
    >Diagrams that outline the steps a user might take during the experience as they go from step to step in the UI.
    2. Wireframe. 
    >A rough skeleton representation of the UI and the various components that make up the UI.
3. **Implementation**
    1. Prototypes. 
    >An interactive, high fidelity working prototype.
4. **Report**
    1. Usability Reporting. 
    >Observe real users using the application and how they navigate through different actions.
    
I will do one or two cycle of step 2, 3, and 4 after I've gotten feedback from real users to improve the application. <br><br>
